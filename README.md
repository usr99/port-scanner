# port-scanner
A really basic port scanner written in Rust

It was supposed to be a nmap-killer but I guess nmap is still going fine.
First project written entirely in Rust: I made so many mistakes that the whole project is just garbage and would need a full rewrite.
I just hope it made me a better programmer, time will tell.
